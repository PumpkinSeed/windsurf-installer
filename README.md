# Windsurf IDE Installer

Windsurf IDE installer for Linux systems.

## Motivation

The Windsurf page only had an option for Debian based systems, so I wanted to make it available for more users.

## Usage

- Run the following command to install Windsurf IDE.
- You can run it as many times as you like, as it overwrites the previous installation.
- To update, simply run it againâ€”it always installs the latest version.

```sh
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PumpkinSeed/windsurf-installer/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sh
```

## Features

- Creates desktop icon
- Print suggestion to add Windsurf to the path
- Easy to install/update
